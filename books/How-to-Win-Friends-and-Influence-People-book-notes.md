## Handling People

**1. Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.**
	Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Try to understand the point of view of the other person in order to foster sympathy, tolerance and kindness.

**3. Give honest and sincere appreciation.**
	The only way to get someone do to something is to make the person want to do it. Appreciation is sincere; flattery is not. Make an effort to identify and verbalize the good points in others.

**4. Arouse in the other person an eager want.**
	The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. Offer and demonstrate how your product can solve other people’s problems.

## Making People Like You
**1. Become genuinely interested in other people.**
	People are not interested in you; they are interested in themselves 24/7/365. Greet people with animation and enthusiasm.

**2. Smile.**
	The expression on your face is more important than the clothes you wear on your back.

**3. Remember the person's name.**
	Remembering a person’s name and using it in conversation is a powerful but subtle compliment.

**4. Be a good listener.**
	Don't talk incessantly about yourself. Don't interrupt in the middle of a sentence. Listen to what the other person is passionate about and remember it.

**5. Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.**
	Guest of Theodore Roosevelt were astonished at his range of knowledge. But he had a secret trick he used: “Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested. For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.”

**6. Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely.**
	In order to say something kind about another person, observe and ask yourself: *“What is there about this person that I can honestly admire?”* Strive to radiate happiness and “pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return.”
	
## Winning People to Your Way of Thinking
**1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.**
Suggestions for keeping a disagreement from escalating:
- Welcome the disagreement
- Distrust your first instinctive impression
- Control your temper
- Listen first
- Look for areas of agreement
- Be honest
- Promise to think over your opponent’s ideas
- Thank your opponents for their interest
- Postpone action to think through the problem

**2. Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong”.**
	Telling people they are wrong strikes a direct blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect. Phrases like “I might be wrong, but let’s examine the facts” is one way to diplomatically approach wrong ideas.

**3. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.**
	When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong – and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves – let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.

**4. Begin in a friendly way.**
	Lincoln: “It is an old and true maxim that ‘a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.’ So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.” Friendliness begets friendliness.

**5. Get the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately.**
	A ‘No’ response is a difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said ‘No,’ all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. Look to the Socratic method: “His whole technique was based upon getting a ‘yes, yes’ response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.”

**6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.**
	Talk less and listen more.

**7. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.**
	Results are more important than getting credit for an idea. No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.

**8. Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.**
	There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason – and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.
	
**9. Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.**
	3/4 of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.

**10. Appeal to the nobler motives.**
	A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one. One strategy for changing or influencing others is to appeal to their nobler motives. Make an appeal to the person’s sense of honesty, fairness, integrity and sincerity.

**11. Dramatize your ideas.**
	Create a worthy narrative around your ideas. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. This idea is necessary in order to earn attention and stand above your peers and competitors.

**12. Throw down a challenge.**
	Interesting, stimulating and exciting work is, in itself, a kind of motivation for people: it makes them look forward to the challenge. The desire to excel instills a feeling of importance in people and feeling important is one of the greatest universal desires.

## Becoming a Leader
**1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.**
	It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.
**2. Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.**
	Consider eliminating the word “but”: “Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word ‘but’ and ending with a critical statement.” The part after the “but” makes people question the sincerity of the initial praise. Change the word “but” to “and.” The result is no inference of failure in the second part of the statement.

**3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.**
	It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.

**4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**
	Asking questions gives others a chance to figure out how to do things themselves and gives them ownership and a sense of importance over the task. Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.

**5. Let the other person save face.**
	We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person’s pride. Whereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!

**6. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.**
	Be specific in your praise: “Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.

**7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.**
	If you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.

**8. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.**
	Emphasize the positive and be careful not to discourage through too much focus on mistakes and errors. The goal is to foster a desire to improve rather than foster a desire to quit.

**9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.**
	Making the person feel important is key. When asking someone to perform a task that might seem undesirable, be sure to consider and articulate the benefits that align with the person’s wants.
